2nd Commit for Sandwich Club

The goal of the "Sandwich Club" is to write a JSON utility that will read in a JSON string and populate a "Detail View".  Unfinished items required to be completed are:

1) Write the JSON Utility
2) Correctly complete the activity_detail.xml layout file so that individual items from the JSON input are correctly displayed
3) Complete the "PopulateUI" function in DetailActivity.Java that completes the task of displaying the detail items.

This commit contains working version of the project that performed all the above steps and meets basic specifications.
